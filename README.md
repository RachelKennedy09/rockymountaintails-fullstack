## 🧠 Challenges & What I Learned

This project was an incredible learning experience. Here are some of the **wins** and **challenges** I encountered:

### ✅ Wins:
- Built a full-stack app with **backend + frontend integration**
- Created RESTful routes and used MongoDB effectively
- Added **authentication** using session-based login
- Deployed my homepage with **GitHub Pages**
- Used GitHub version control and learned how to organize my project properly

### 😅 Challenges:
- Had to reorganize my entire project mid-way to clean up file paths and folders
- Originally forgot to redirect logout properly to the homepage (fixed it by switching from `req.logout()` to `req.session.destroy()`)
- Learned how to separate my backend app from the GitHub Pages frontend and connect them cleanly
- Debugged image paths and GitHub Pages issues due to incorrect nesting
- Accidentally initialized Git inside a subfolder and had to reset `.git` and remote origin

### 💡 Key Takeaways:
- **Organization is everything** — it's easier to build and debug when the project is clean
- Deploying static sites vs server-side apps requires different strategies (GitHub Pages vs Render)
- I'm now confident with RESTful routes, Express setup, and Git workflow
